# Portfolio Project
This is my portfolio repository where you will find all the files utilised in order to create my portfolio website

## Code stack 
HTML, CSS, SCSS and Javascript

## Purpose
The purpose of this project and ultimately the finalised website is to showcase and market myself as a software developer. It is to be used similar to a business card in that viewers of the page will be able to see my name, job title, skills, projects and have means to contact me directly. 

## Outcomes
- Website contains home/landing, about, skills, projects and contact sections
- website is fully responsive to whatever screen size is applied
